<p>
	You can pass an existing component as content of the modal window. In this case, if you're still using Angular 8 or
	older, remember to add the content component in the <code>entryComponents</code> section of your
	<code>NgModule</code>. For Angular 9 or newer, it's not needed anymore.

<button class="btn btn-lg btn-outline-primary" (click)="open()">Launch demo modal</button>
