<p>
  When using non-manual triggers, you can control the delay to open and close the popover through the <code>openDelay</code> and
  <code>closeDelay</code> properties. Note that the <code>autoClose</code> feature does not use the close delay, it closes the popover immediately.

  Hover 300ms here
</button>
