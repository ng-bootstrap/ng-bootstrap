	If you configure the locale and register the locale data as explained in the
	<a href="https://angular.io/guide/i18n">i18n guide</a>, the time picker will honor the locale and use the day periods
	("AM" and "PM") from the locale data. You can however provide a custom service, as demonstrated in this example, to
	customize the days and months names the way you want to.
