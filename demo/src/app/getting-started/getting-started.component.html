  <h3>
    Dependencies
  </h3>
  <p>
    This repository contains a set of native Angular 2 directives based on Bootstrap's markup and CSS.
    As a result no dependency on jQuery or Bootstrap's JavaScript is required. The only required dependencies are:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <a href="https://angular.io" target="_blank">Angular</a> (<em>requires</em> Angular version 2 or higher, tested
      with 2.0-rc.4)
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="http://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com" target="_blank">Bootstrap CSS</a> (tested with version 4.0 alpha V2)
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>
    Installation
  </h3>
  <p>
    After installing the above dependencies, install <code>ng-bootstrap</code> via:
  </p>
  <pre>
    <code>npm install --save @ng-bootstrap/ng-bootstrap</code>
  </pre>
  <p>
    Once installed, directives may be imported in several different ways:
  </p>
  <p>
    For all the directives (if you simply intend on using everything):
  </p>
  <pre>
    <code>import {NGB_DIRECTIVES} from '@ng-bootstrap/ng-bootstrap';</code>
  </pre>
  <p>
    Or, for specific component directives (using Alert as an example):
  </p>
  <pre>
    <code>import {NGB_ALERT_DIRECTIVES} from '@ng-bootstrap/ng-bootstrap';</code>
  </pre>
  <p>
    Once imported, add your chosen directives on your component's <code>directives</code> array property:
  </p>
  <pre>
    directives: [
      ...
      NGB_DIRECTIVES,
      ...
    ]
  </pre>
  <p>
    Certain directives need to be precompiled in order to be used. This is done via your component's <code>precompile</code>
    array property. The following components require precompilation:
  </p>
  <pre>
    precompile: [
      ...
      NGB_PRECOMPILE,
      ...
    ]
  </pre>
  <p>
    We recommend putting these in the top level component of your application.  So ultimately, you should wind up
    having something that looks like this:
  </p>
  <pre>
    import {Component} from '@angular/core';
    import {NGB_DIRECTIVES, NGB_PRECOMPILE} from '@ng-bootstrap/ng-bootstrap';

    @Component({
      selector: 'app',
      directives: [ NGB_DIRECTIVES ],
      precompile: [ NGB_PRECOMPILE ],
      templateUrl: './app.html',
    })
    export class App {
        ...
    }
  </pre>
