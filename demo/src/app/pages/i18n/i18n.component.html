		We're using standard Angular i18n in ng-bootstrap templates. Since Angular 9 (and ng-bootstrap 6) you have to add
		the additional <code>@angular/localize</code> polyfill to your CLI project. See more details in
		<a href="https://angular.io/guide/i18n#setting-up-localization-with-the-angular-cli" target="_blank"
			>the official documentation</a
		>.
	</ngb-alert>

	<p>
		Some components contain static English text or symbols that you might want to internationalize. Some of them appear
		on the screen, like for example the placeholders used in the timepicker input fields. Others appear in aria
		attributes used for accessibility.
	</p>
	<p>
		Internationalizing the ng-bootstrap components is done the same way as for any of your components, using the
		<a href="https://angular.io/guide/i18n#template-translations">process described in the Angular documentation</a>.
		The only difference is that we already did the first phase of this process: marking static text messages in the
		ng-bootstrap component templates for translation.
	</p>
	<p>
		So, if you execute `ng xi18n` on your project, you will also find the ng-bootstrap messages to translate in the
		generated messages file. All our messages are identified by an ID of the form <code>ngb.[widget].[message]</code>
